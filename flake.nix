# Welcome to the main example config of nixCats!
# there is a minimal flake the starter templates use
# within the nix directory without the nixpkgs input,
# but this one would work too!
# Every config based on nixCats is a full nixCats.

# This example config doesnt use lazy.nvim, and
# it loads everything via nix.

# It has some useful tricks
# in it, especially for lsps, so if you have any questions,
# first look through the docs, and then here!
# It has examples of most of the things you would want to do
# in your main nvim configuration.

# If there is still not adequate info, ask in discussions
# on the nixCats repo (or open a PR to add the info to the help!)

    # If you want your plugin to be loaded by the standard overlay,
    # i.e. if it wasnt on nixpkgs, but doesnt have an extra build step.
    # Then you should name it "plugins-something"
    # If you wish to define a custom build step not handled by nixpkgs,
    # then you should name it in a different format, and deal with that in the
    # overlay defined for custom builds in the overlays directory.
